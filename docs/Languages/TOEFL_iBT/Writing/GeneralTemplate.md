## 综合写作

### #1

主题 is the focus of both the writer and the professor. In the writing, three 三个 TS 的所属类别, including A, B and C, have been elaborated. The professor, however, claims that all such assumptions are incorrect.  

(解决问题型：The professor, however, claims that all such problems can be addressed.)

- As opposed to the writer’s idea that 阅读的 TS1, the professor states that 听力的 TS1. Citing the instance of 例子名称, he / she advances the theory by saying that 听力的细节.
- The professor continues to discredit the writing’s assertion that 阅读的 TS2, by examining the fact that 听力的TS2. In detail, he / she points that 听力的细节.
- It is the professor’s third argument that 听力的TS3, which contradicts the view of the writer that 阅读的 TS3. To explore deeper, the professor contends that 听力的细节.

An apparent divide exists between the writer and the professor on 主题.

### #2

Separate while contradictory views on 主题 have been made known by the writer and the professor. Meanwhile, both their assertions are delivered from three distinct angles: A, B and C. The professor expresses contrasting views against the writer.  

(解决问题型：The professor handles each problem the writer raises.)

- Contrary to the writer’s first idea that 阅读的 TS1, the professor indicates that 听力的 TS1. She / He reinforces his / her statement by saying that 听力的细节.
- The professor then moves forward to argue against the reading’s next point that 阅读的 TS2, by referring to the fact that 听力的 TS2. In detail, he / she reasons that 听力的细节.
- In opposition to the final explanation in the reading that 阅读的 TS3 is the professor’s third argument – 听力的 TS3. He / She justifies himself / herself by demonstrating that 听力的细节.

Apparently, the professor holds a different perspective from the writer in terms of 主题.

### #3

Both the writer and the lecturer focus on 主题. The writer claims that the three possible 三个 TS 的所属类别 are A, B and C. However, the lecturer strongly opposes all these assertions.  

(解决问题型：However, the lecturer confidently proposes solutions to them.)

- While the writer states that 阅读的 TS1, the lecturer believes that 听力的 TS1. She further explains that 听力的细节.
- The reading next points out that 阅读的 TS2. The lecturer discredits this by arguing that 听力的 TS2. She adds that 听力的细节.
- Finally, the writer asserts that 阅读的 TS3. However, the lecturer counters by stating that 听力的 TS3. She advances the argument saying that 听力的细节.

In summary, the lecturer and the writer contradict each other on 主题.
